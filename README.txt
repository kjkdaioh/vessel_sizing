nozzle inlet devices and demisters(if needed).
2) GUI based on one of python libraries (tkinter or pygame).
3) Integration of results to pre-made excel sheet.
4) Use of python exe library, so everybody will be able to 
run the program w/o installing the python.

********************************************
Restrictions:
1) Work to be done using Git and GitHub as a part of learning
